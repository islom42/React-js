When it comes to course requirements, it would be extremely beneficial if you would be familiar with

the Schimmel sisters and most importantly, Joska.

I can honestly say that the more JavaScript, especially ESX, you know, the easier it's going to be.

Pick up Riak, because at the end of the day, react is just Joska.

So if you're familiar with things like Spirit, Operator, R.O., the destruction, etc., you'll be

in good shape.

Now, it's not the end of the world.

If you're still getting comfortable with JavaScript, just keep in mind that once in a while you will

have to do some extra studying, since it is my assumption that you are familiar with JavaScript topics.

And while I will try to cover as much JavaScript info as possible, please understand that at the end

of the day this is a react course.

Now, if you need to brush up on your JavaScript knowledge or if you'd like to find out more about specific

JavaScript topic during the course, I would suggest utilizing my YouTube channel coding more specifically

playlists called JavaScript Nuggets where we cover react specific JavaScript topics.

I'm constantly adding new topics.

So while at the time of recording there are only three videos, by the time you'll be watching this,

there will be more shogan of the channel that you are looking for is coding and more specifically,

the playlist name is a JavaScript Nuggets.

So the way it works as I'm recording the course and once I hit a specific just topic, for example,

map or unique values or dynamic object keys, I will create a separate video about that, just in case

you would want to find out more about the topic.
