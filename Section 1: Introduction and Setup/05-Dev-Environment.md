When it comes to our environment, we will need following tools not just installed on our machine web

browser, I would suggest Google Chrome, but technically it is optional.

As long as you have a Web browser, you'll be good to go.

Just remember that once in a while your results might differ because the browser that you choose, if

it's a different browser other than Google Chrome, maybe, I don't know, display just a little bit

differently than a text letter.

Again, I would suggest visual studio code, but we all have our preferences, so no hard feelings as

well as react developer tools which are not required but will improve your dev experience in the long

run.

And I guess let's go down less than first one.

We have a node now in order to check whether you have node installed already on your machine in a terminal,

you would need to run node and then dash dash version so you'll see where the note is installed.

And then if it's successful, it will also tell you what is the version.

And then if you don't have it installed, then it's probably going to say something along the lines

that it cannot find the command or something like that.

And what you're shooting for is at least five point two, because later we will use a package called

create a React app, and more specifically, we'll use and install it.

And that comes with a version of five point minimum.

Of course, if you have a higher version, that is even better.

So in order to test it out, I don't have navigate right now to my terminal, a massively zoom in just

so you can see what is happening.

And we type here node, dash, dash version.

So of course it's bits back that I have version 12.

OK, so I'm good to go.

Now, if you don't have node installed, I would suggest navigating to now just Doug.

And of course you can just get there by going to Google and typing node for example, you can say node

and of course the first link that's going to pop up is going to be node as a dog and they will right

away detect which operating system you're using.

So in my case, that is Mark and then I would shoot for a long term support option.

So click it over here and you'll get yourself now.

No, I'm not going to install it since I already have it on my machine and also is just clicking a bunch

of checkboxes.

Then we have Google Chrome.

So again, if you don't have it, go for Google Chrome.

And then one of the first links is going to be to a page where, of course, you can download Chrome.

Then we have Visual Studio Code.

So just look for Visual Studio.

Code is a awesome open source text letter from Microsoft.

That is just amazing as far as the development experience.

And once you go to their site, which is code that visual studio dot com again, they will detect which

operating system you're using and you can right away get yourself a nice fresh out of the oven copy

off the visual studio code.

Then we've got a reactive developer tools, then just look for them.

And one of the links is going to be right away to the extensions.

And then of course, in my case, I already have it, so I would need to remove it.

But in your case, if you don't have it installed, then of course you'll have to add to Chrome.

So you add that extension and what you're looking for are the components and the profiler.

Keep in mind that, of course, if, for example, you are at the page that doesn't use react and of

course, it's just going to be great.

And what I'm talking about this little like I notice this reactive apparatus and essentially it's going

to be great.

However, if the site is using react, then of course you'll be able to see it and then once you open

up the console.

So of course, you can either do it with a shortcut, which I believe was option command and I and there

it is.

And what you're looking for is this profiler and components.

Again, I'm not going to look at them right now because it's not going to make sense.

But eventually, as we're progressing with, of course, you will see how reactive our portals will

make your life a little bit easier as far as working with a react application.
