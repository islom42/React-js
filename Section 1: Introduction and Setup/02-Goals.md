Before we go any further, let's also cover the main goals of the course and tell you honestly, there's

only one.

By the end of the course, I would want you to be comfortable with REAC.

Now, what that means to me is that you can do two things.

First, you are aware of external resources and more importantly, you're comfortable with using them

when you want to learn something new about react.

So essentially, you know where to find useful info.

And second, you are comfortable applying theory to practice by building your own projects, using react.

Now, those are nice, but what is my plan to get you there?

And the answer is simple.

By building a bunch of projects using react, you see, the course goal is not to cover every smallest

aspect of react ecosystem, since it's impossible.

A course that covers everything that there is to know about react doesn't exist.

While the core API of react is actually quite small, since it is by far the most popular framework

out there, the ecosystem surrounding react is as vast as you can imagine.

What that means is that essentially there will be always something new to learn about react.

And that's why I would suggest adopting a student mindset.

Instead, we're always open to expanding your reac knowledge.

In my experience, the best way to learn and get comfortable with language or framework is by building

a bunch of projects.

So that's exactly what we'll do during this course.

We'll start small.

Our first project will be somewhat silly, but slowly and surely we will expand on our knowledge and

by the end of the course you will be comfortable building your own complex reac apps.
