Far as my specific text and are setup, meaning what extensions I'm using and which ones I would suggest

using during the course as well as well as my son Jason, I'm not going to cover them too much in this

video because essentially I don't see the point once we start building the reactor application than

one by one, or I'll set up a separate video where essentially I'll show you all the extensions that

I would suggest getting and also what settings we would need to set it up in our visual studio code

and attacks that are now if you are impatient and if you would want to see all the extensions that I'm

using as well as my settings, you can just navigate to mark it up and handle is John Hyphen Smilde.

And the report that you're looking for is the first code set up.

And in here you'll find all the extensions that I'm using as well as small description and also my settings.

Jason.

Now, again, let me reiterate that little bit later in the course, I will cover which extensions are

crucial for you to follow along, meaning which will make your life much easier as you're working with

react and also want settings you need to set up in your settings.

Jason.

But if you want to see them right now, everything that I'm using, even though some extensions are

not required for discourse, then I can navigate to a repo, which is John Hyphen Smeagol and then Verst

code set up.

And here you'll find my settings, Jason, as well as all the extensions that I currently have in my

visual studio code.
