Well, create react app is a awesome tool, one of the issues that I have, especially as we just start

exploring the react world, is the fact that there's a bunch of boilerplate.

And in my opinion, it will help us the most if we start everything from scratch.

I would want you to do something barbaric, and that is to delete pretty much all the files in the source

apart from Index Ajaz.

So I would want you to select obsolescence.

I'm Jass also.

The app does just the index logo, 3G service worker and setup test.

So pretty much all the files apart from Index Jass, I would want you to delete them.

Yes, we would want to remove all these files.

So at the moment we just have the index chart and indexed.

Yes, I also want to wipe it clean so just delete all the content that we currently have in the index.

Yes.

Now, of course, when you're on IBM start, don't be surprised that there will be a big fat error.

Don't worry.

Once we create our first component, then of course this error will be fixed.

But for the time being, we just want to remove all this unnecessary boilerplate that we had in a source

folder.

So that should be a start where we have a clean screen and of course we can create our first react component.
