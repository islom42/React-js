Well, there are many ways how to set up react application by far the easiest and fastest would be using

create React app, which is built by Facebook developers, and it allows us to just focus on building

our apps instead of spending our precious time on tinkering with configuration and build those.

If you are interested in finding out more about the package, just type the name in search engine and

look for the link in the report.

I would like to reemphasize, though, technically you don't need to use, create, react app to work

with Riak.

You can build the whole set up yourself.

But trust me when I say that in the long run, create react app will save you a bunch of time as well

as some sanity, because while tinkering with Watpac sounds a lot of fun in the beginning, in reality

it can get nutty pretty pretty fast and that hurt.

Create React app uses babble and Watpac and well we're still on the subject.

Let me just quickly cover them as well.

So a Bible is a JavaScript transponder that converts the numerous JavaScript into the good old JavaScript

so we can use all the newest features of the JavaScript language.

So think things like an operator restructuring and all the other goodies that come with ESX.

And behind the scenes babble will turn into years five, which in turn will make sure that our app runs

smoothly and the older browsers as well.

So essentially we can have our cake and eat it too.

Well, WABAC does a lot of other things as well.

Essentially, Watpac works as a module.

Bandler, the main features of Watpac would be bundling our resources, watching for changes and running

Babul transpire.
