As I know during the course, you'll be asked to review the course, and even though I understand that

everyone is busy and leaving a review seems like a waste of time.

I would greatly appreciate if you could find a few minutes in your schedule and write a brief course

of you just so I understand what you like or dislike about the course and hopefully make my next course

better.

By the way, you don't have to write a paragraph or a novel.

One or two sentences will be greatly appreciated.
