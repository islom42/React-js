Far as the core structure, we're going to start by setting up our dev environment, so think that our

browser or basic terminal command and et cetera, followed by extensive react to Turrill during which

we will build already some small project to enforce that particular subject matter that we're learning.

And once we're done with the drill, will simply put our heads down, roll up our sleeves and build

a project like there's no tomorrow.

Now, this is not the very end of the course.

We'll also cover Redox and why it is used.

While I'm fully aware that the first part, the set apart might seem tedious, boring and maybe even

unnecessary, please keep in mind that it is extremely important for me that all of us are on the same

page.

And don't worry, we'll get to react in time.
