Hi, guys, is John from the Future with a quick update since I recorded the course, really came out

with a newer version.

So the latest version is 17.

And even though there are no breaking changes, meaning all the course content is still relevant, it's

not obsolete.

There are two minor gotchas that I want to talk about.

First, when it comes to components, you don't have to import react anymore.

So in the upcoming videos, I cover how to import react and why it's necessary in order to set up the

component.

But with the latest version, you don't have to import it anymore.

Now, nothing bad will happen if you still write the import statement, but in order to save on some

boilerplate code, starting with React version 17, it's not mandatory anymore.

So in the upcoming videos, I'll show you that in the previous versions we needed to import, react

and then from react.

And of course, I cover all the details in the upcoming videos.

But now with the latest version, you don't have to do that again.

Let me repeat, nothing bad will happen if you do do it.

But in order to save some boilerplate code, you can just amend the statement and everything is going

to work perfectly fine.

And second, some students in general, some people experience some issues with heart reloading.

Now, what is a hard rewarding role in creating react?

There's this thing where any time I make some changes in a component or in the latest challenge will

right away be shown in a browser.

So in my case, if I go to my button and if I just add some text, notice how I write.

We can see these changes.

Now, the problem with the reactivity is that they switch how they're showing those latest changes.

And for some people, it is not working.

So some of you might still need to hit the refresh button in order to see those changes.

And the problem is, as far as I can see, there is no silver bullet, meaning there is no solution

that works for everyone.

So if you go to your favorite search engine and just type create a react app, hot, reloading, not

working, you'll see some nice solutions.

And the one that seems to be working for most.

But again, I emphasize the word most because it doesn't work for everyone is setting up the end variables

file and then add fast refresh false.

Now, I'm totally aware that some of you are a bit lost at the moment because you don't know what it

is, a re file and why we're adding that fast refresh.

And don't worry, later in the course I do show you how to set up the new file and what is actually

the purpose for that.

But just to fix this bug, you can try doing this work, go to the root again.

Don't do that in the source.

Do it in a road where you go with DOT and that's the file name and then you need to go with fast.

Underscore, refresh and set it equal to falls again, as far as I can tell, that works for most students

and then of course, don't forget to restart your server.

So you need to stop the server.

You do that by control C and then restart the server.

And if that doesn't work, my best suggestion is, again, going into your search engine and just look

for solutions and you'll have to try some things out.

Again, it's impossible for me to go to your computer and test out your local environment.

This is the case where you'll have to tinker around a little bit and you need to find a solution that

works for you, where eventually, any time you make a change in your component or in the success,

the latest challenge will be displayed in the browser.
