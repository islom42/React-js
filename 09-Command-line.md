Obviously, everyone was successful setting up the development and now we can move on to the next phase

of our setup.

Normally, this would be the point where we download and examine, create, react app tool or there's

something that I would like to cover first.

And that is no other than the scary terminal and some of its most popular and used commands.

You see, even though this is an area, of course, we will use come online and and PM during the course,

so we might as well get some basics out of the way.

Now, if you're already comfortable with Terminal one and PM, which, by the way, will cover in the

next video, feel free to skip these videos.

If, however, you are seeing the scary terminal for the first time, hopefully you'll not feel that

way after watching this video.

Please keep in mind, though, we will just cover the basics.

So if you'd like to learn more, I would suggest utilizing endless YouTube videos and media and blog

posts about come online and its commands.

And first question coming out of your mouth is probably along the lines.

Well, water is terminal and why would we want to use it or say.

If you're watching this course, it is safe to assume that you have successfully tackled the graphical

interface, at least the basics, the GUI, what is going?

Well, it is this is the icons.

We can find more commands and along those lines.

Now, what we can also do is control our computer, not just using the gooey the graphical interface,

but also the command line.

And that's where the terminal comes in.

I fully understand that the first time seeing this is scary, but don't worry, it is not as bad as

it looks like.

And the first commander I would want to look at is be W.D., which will show us a full path now to a

current directory.

So where are we at as far as our machine in the terminal.

So we just might be W.T. And I can tell right away that we will be in route.

By the way, you can notice this by this little symbol.

OK, so now where is my road?

It is for its users and then forward slash mine last time.

So that is my route directory.

Now, if I would want to see what directory I have in that folder.

Well, I just go by Alloush and this is going to speed back what directory I have in my directory now

to prove my point where to navigate to my hard drive online.

I'm looking for the users and I'm looking for my last name and there it is.

And I can clearly see that I'm not making this up.

I'm in the road right now and the finder as well as in my command line.

Now, if I would want to navigate to a specific folder, we would need to type seed and then whatever

folder name.

So in this case, if I would want to navigate to a desktop, I would just need to write desktop and

that's it.

Now, of course, we navigate to address them and I can clearly see that here as well.

Now, if I would want to navigate one level up, basically back to a parent, I would need to go to

city and dot dot.

Now, of course, you can again see that I'm sitting in the road.

So if we would want to navigate back to invest up again, we would type KDDI desktop or also remember

that we have option of using Arrow up or down where we can look for previous commands.

So if I'll just press Arauca up notice, this will give me the last command, which of course is navigating

back to the parent.

However, if I press it one more time, this will speed back the desktop.

So of course I can run the command again by pressing return.

And of course I'm in a desktop.

Not once I'm in the desktop.

If all else, you'll notice that technically it doesn't return anything, but because of course my desktop

is empty or there's going to be maybe some cases once in a while where you would want to also check

for hidden folders.

And most likely in our course, that is going to have to do with Git.

And in that case, you can run with unless I'm on my phone and then I.

So this will also show you hidden folders.

Now, that is a little bit out of the scope of the course, so don't worry about it too much.

We're not going to utilize it that often.

But once in a while, you maybe would want to just double check whether there is a get as far as your

folder structure.

Now, once that is done, why don't we create a new directory?

And to do that, we would need to run amok.

The I r so here we can clear the console.

And by the way, for that we have a command of clear so we can clear the console.

And now in a desktop I'm going to make a new directory and I'm just going to call this testing.

So I'm going to go with AMK, the IRR and then testing.

And there is now of course I have my testing folder now in order to navigate through that directory

again, either I would need to run city and then testing or there's also another option where I can

just have the event space and then just grab this particular folder, sort of just drag and drop over

here.

And now notice it right away.

Tells me that I would navigate to your users.

That's Melgar, that desktop and then testing.

So once I press on over here, notice how I'm nicely sitting in the testing folder and what else we

have.

We have city code now that so that's going to navigate again to a parent and clearing the console,

which already we have covered, so.

Now, let's start out how we can navigate outside, of course, again, where we go and and again,

we're sitting in the snow.

So those would be the basic commands of the terminal.

And hopefully you don't feel as scared as you did in the beginning of the video.
